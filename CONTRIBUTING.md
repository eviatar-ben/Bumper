Inside github, fork the upstream repository.

Clone your own fork of the project.

Before starting to implement a new feature or fixing a bug, make sure to pull master (or develop) branch from the upstream repository, and only then create your branch.

Push your code and open a PR against the upstream repository develop branch.
